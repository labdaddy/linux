####To Recover the root password
- Reboot the machine
- Press up or down arrow to pause the grub menu
- Press the 'e' key to edit the grub entry
- Scroll down to the line that begins with 'linx 16'
- Skip to the end of the line with: `ctrl-e`
- Delete the last two words, 'rhgb' and 'quiet'
- Add the following: `rd.break` `enforcing=0`
- Continue the boot process by typing: `ctrl-x`
- Boot process will continue but only up to the point where you have access to the `switch_root:/#` prompt
- `Ctrl-l` will put your prompt back up at the top of the screen
- Type: `mount -o remount,rw /sysroot` and press enter
- Then type: `chroot /sysroot`
- The prompt changes to `sh-4.2` (or something similar, indicating the kernel version)
- At the new prompt type: `passwd` to reset the root password
- Type a new password and press enter
- Exit out of the chroot environment with: `exit`
- Retrieve the previous mount command with the up arrow and change it to read: `mount -o remount,ro /sysroot`
- Now continue the boot process with: `exit`
- Now we get the standard prompt where we will enter our root password:
- Security context will need to be restored with: `restorecon /etc/shadow` and enter
- Next to return to enforcing mode in selinux, type: `setenforce 1`
