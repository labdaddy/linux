#### su - vs su
- su - invokes a login shell after switching the user. A login shell resets most environment variables, providing a clean base.
- su just switches the user, providing a normal shell with an environment nearly the same as with the old user.
#### sudo bang bang
- `sudo !!` 
This will repeat the last command with sudo priveleges so you don't have to re-write it.
